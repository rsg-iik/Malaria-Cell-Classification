# Malaria-Infected-Cell-Classification-using-Deep Learning
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. 
Earlier, malaria was mostly diagnosed in the laboratory setting requiring a great deal of human expertise.
Automatic systems such as those relying on machine learning techniques were initially studied to overcome this problem.
Automation of the diagnosis process will provide accurate diagnosis of the disease, which will benefit health-care to resource-scarce areas.
Several Machine learning techinques have been used for automated diagnosis of malaria.
In this project, I have used deep learning techniques to discriminate between infected cells and uninfected cells.
I have used the transfer learning with pre-trained VGG-19 architecture in this project.
